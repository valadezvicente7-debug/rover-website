        <h3 style="color: brown;">Major Design Project: Autonomous Rover</h3>

        <p>
            Create an autonomous rover capable of navigating to specified GPS coordinates and delivering a
            payload. For your missions the payload will be modeled as a cubic wooden block ~1.5”x1.5”x1.5”.
            The rover should be capable of obstacle avoidance, navigating rough/uneven/sandy terrain, and
            meeting speed and navigation accuracy requirements. Missions your team should meet to
            demonstrate timely progress and project functionality are as follows:
        </p>

        <!-- Mission 1 -->
        <details>
            <summary>1. Rolling Chassis (will require two consecutive successful runs)</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>a. Rolling Chassis:</b> drive in a ~10ft square pattern, stop at original location and deliver
                    payload. The marker should be within 3ft of the rover’s original location and the
                    mission should be completed within 60 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>b. Rolling Chassis:</b> drive straight for 15-30ft and place physical marker. The rover will
                    read the specific intended distance from an RF transmitter beacon at the starting
                    location. The marker should be within +/- 10% of the specified drive distance and the
                    task should be completed in less than 30 seconds.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The distance to drive will be transmitted as a 12-character message. The
                            distance will be two digits preceded by an ‘X’. The remainder of the message
                            will be padded with ‘Z’ characters. For example, the message for the rover to
                            travel 15 feet would be “X15ZZZZZZZZZ”.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The distance to be traveled will be continuously transmitted from the RF
                            beacon at 5 second intervals.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <!-- Mission 2 -->
        <details>
            <summary>2. Obstacle avoidance (Without GPS Navigation) (will require two consecutive successful runs)</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>a.</b> Drive in an enclosed area (approx 6’x6’) without contacting walls or obstacles. The
                    mission will last 60 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>b.</b> Drive forward to waypoint 30’ directly ahead of robot. Demonstrate avoidance
                    algorithm by continuing to original waypoint after navigating around a single
                    obstacle. The rover should deliver payload within 5ft of the marked waypoint and
                    complete the mission in under 120 seconds.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <!-- Mission 3 -->
        <details>
            <summary>3. Basic GPS navigation (will require two consecutive successful runs)</summary>
            <p class="subtext">
                Point due North. From an arbitrary start location and heading, navigate so that the
                rover is pointing due North. Point north within +/- 20° and complete the mission
                within 180 seconds. Deliver payload to signify mission completion.
            </p>
            <p class="subtext">
                Full credit will require completion of the mission on rough or sandy terrain.
            </p>
        </details>

        <!-- Mission 4 -->
        <details>
            <summary>4. Advanced GPS navigation</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>a.</b> Navigate to specified GPS waypoint that will be provided to you. You may hardcode
                    the GPS waypoint coordinates for this mission. The rover should deliver payload
                    within 15 feet of the marked GPS waypoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>b.</b> The rover should read the GPS coordinates from an RF transmitter beacon placed at
                    the starting location, place a physical marker within 15 feet of the specified waypoint,
                    and return to original start location. The distance between the physical marker and
                    the marked waypoint will be measured along with the distance between start and end
                    positions of the rover. The cumulative error should not exceed 25 feet.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The GPS coordinates of the waypoint will be transmitted as a 12-character
                            message. The latitude coordinate will be 5 digits preceded by an ‘N’, the
                            longitude will be 5 digits preceded by a ‘W’. The 5 digits of the latitude
                            represent the decimals that would be appended to 39; the five digits following
                            W represent the decimals that would be appended to -108 to form the
                            longitude. For example, the message for the rover to travel to 39.09495N by
                            -108.58784W would be “N09495W58784”.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Coordinates will be continuously transmitted by the RF beacon at 5 second
                            interval.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using this coding algorithm will allow your rover to travel in the shaded
                            region indicated below. Travel outside of this region would require additional
                            digits to be transmitted.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="subtext">
                Full credit will require completion of the mission on rough or sandy terrain.

        <!-- Other Requirements -->
        <details>
            <summary>Other rover requirements include:</summary>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Maximum weight:</b> The rover weight (including payload) should not exceed 2.5 pounds</li>
                <li><b>Robustness:</b> The rover should be capable of completing any mission following an 18” drop</li>
                <li><b>Weather resistance:</b> The rover should be capable of completing the final mission in simulated rainy conditions (a.k.a. the “sprinkler test”)</li>
                <li><b>Original design:</b> Preference should be given to original designs developed by the team rather than relying on commercial kits or externally sourced designs.</li>
